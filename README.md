Passepartout is your go-to app for VPN and privacy.

Passepartout runs on [iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV][appstore].

## Features

[OpenVPN®][openvpn] and [WireGuard®][wireguard] client for Apple platforms, the OpenVPN stack also implements the [Tunnelblick XOR patch][openvpn-xor-patch].

Other features:

- On-demand rules
- Override DNS and HTTP proxy
- Custom routing
- Presets for multiple providers (virtually any)

Tailored for Apple platforms:

- Apple TV
- iCloud
- Shortcuts
- No background activities
- Wise on battery

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 16+ / macOS 13+ / tvOS 17+
- Xcode 16+
- SwiftPM 5.9
- Git (preinstalled with the Xcode Command Line Tools)

It's highly recommended that you use the Git and Ruby packages provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].

### Testing

Download the app codebase locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/partout-io/passepartout
$ git submodule update --init submodules/partout
```

then find the Xcode project in `app-apple`. For everything to work properly, you must comply with all the capabilities and entitlements in the main app and the tunnel extension target. Therefore, you must update the `Config.xcconfig` file according to your developer account.

To test the app on your Mac or iOS/tvOS Simulator:

- Open `Passepartout.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Run the `Passepartout` target

### Binaries

All the [GitHub Releases][github-releases] come with Mac .dmg images for arm64 and x86_64, though currently limited to free features only. It's recommended that you verify the GPG signatures with [my GPG key][gpg-key], which you can also fetch from the public keyservers:

```
gpg --recv-keys 28891B14B2635EA11F438034092E0218047A5650
```

### Homebrew

You can install the Mac app with [Homebrew Cask][homebrew-cask] too:

```shell
brew install passepartout
```
